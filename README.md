# Particle Life

This is a minimal constructor-only scaffold for a Particle Life project.
It provides package metadata and a simple source layout.
The code includes only basic configuration and wrapper classes.
No simulation logic or analysis logic is implemented.
This scaffold is intended as a clean starting point for future development.
