# Particle Life Python+HTML Rebuild

This is a fresh Python backend + HTML UI reimplementation based only on the
reference directory `particle-life-app/`.

## What was matched

- The reference directory currently has no source files.
- Therefore this rebuild intentionally has:
  - no simulation update rules,
  - no tunable parameters,
  - an empty initial state.

## Run

From the repository root:

```bash
python particle_life_python_html/app.py
```

Open: <http://localhost:8000>
